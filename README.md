## 
The solution is comprised of three projects:
- grade-scores_lib - library used by the other two projects.
- grade-scores - the requested program.
- grade-scores_test - unit tests.

execution of unit tests runs automatically on check-in via a CI service at appveyor.com.
appveyor.yml - appveyor configuration file.

The code is designed in a way that simplifies its maintenance, for example when this code grows, based on SOLID programming principles.
